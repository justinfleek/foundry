-- | Pure state machine abstractions for async I/O.
--
-- The core pattern is the Mealy machine:
--
-- @
--   State × Event → State × [Operation]
-- @
--
-- Machines are pure: no IO in step/generate, only in the runner.
-- This enables deterministic replay testing.

-- Implementations define: @step state event → (state, [operation])@
--
-- Laws:
--
-- 1. @done (stepState (step m (initial m) e))@ should eventually become True
--    for well-behaved machines
-- 2. @step@ must be pure and deterministic
-- 3. Operations returned by @step@ are requests to the kernel, not effects

  -- | Process an event, returning new state and operations to submit
  step :: m -> State m -> Event -> StepResult (State m)

  -- | Check if machine has completed its work
  done :: m -> State m -> Bool

-- | Generator machine: can produce operations without waiting for completions.
--
-- Used for bulk operations where we know the work upfront (e.g., stat 10000 files).
-- The runner calls @generate@ when the ring has capacity and @wantsToSubmit@ is True.

-- | Replay executor: runs a machine against a recorded event stream.
