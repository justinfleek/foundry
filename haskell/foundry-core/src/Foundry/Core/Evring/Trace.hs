-- | Event trace recording and replay for deterministic testing.
--
-- A 'Trace' captures completion events from a machine run, allowing
-- exact replay without actual I/O. This is the key to testability:
-- record once, replay deterministically forever.
--
-- Usage:
--
-- @
-- -- Record a trace during actual I/O
-- (result, trace) <- runTraced ring machine
--
-- -- Later, replay without I/O
-- let replayResult = replay machine (traceEvents trace)
-- @
