## Welcome

If you are holding this guide, and reading these words, you are probably as into AI as we are.

Sentience cares about one thing above all else — easy to use, hyper-intuitive AI solutions.

Our goal is to simplify the process of interacting with dApps — in the SingularityNET Ecosystem, and beyond.

The following pages are full of guidelines, rules, and handy tips that will help you communicate our values, realize our mission, and reinforce our Brand. It is impossible to predict every situation, brand execution, or implementation, but we hope this guide will help you refine your approach.

Whether you are a Designer, Writer, or Content Creator helping us share our story, thank you for joining us on this journey, and we look forward to seeing what you create.

**Sincerely, welcome to the Sentience Brand!**

## Intent of This Guide

> "Its an exciting future we are forging together, and we are happy you are joining us on this mission."
> — Logan Ryan Golema, CEO of SophiaVerse

This Style Guide is a reference for our internal design team, contracted designers, and content creators who are authorized to work with the Sentience Brand.

Our intent with this guide is not to restrict creativity or innovation, as these are some of the main core values we hold as a company. Rather we aim to deliver a cohesive message across all touch points, and create a coordinated, consistent, and effective Brand presence in everything we do.

While some of our Brand executions and graphics have been standardized — like business cards, letterhead, envelopes, etc — these are not intended as the focus of this Guide.

Instead the focus of this Guide is to empower you, the Creative, with the tools to create amazing content that drives our message home.

Please refer back to this guide often. If you have any questions concerning the content of this Guide, please dont hesitate to reach out to our Media Team at **media@sentience.com**

## Our Logo

The Sentience Logo consists of two components: the **Icon** (pinecone) and the **Wordmark** ("SENTIENCE").

Our logo is how we distinguish ourselves in the competitive blockchain / tech space. The **Sentience Logo** identifies the Sentience Brand as a whole. Use this logo as our digital signature in Brand Campaigns, and across all Brand Collateral as a whole whenever possible.

**This Logo is a carefully created piece of locked artwork that should not be altered in any way.**

Additional treatments must be approved by members of the **Sentience Media Team** at media@sentience.com

---

## The Pinecone

The pinecone is the embodiment of Sentience's vision: a decentralized, harmonious system that grows more complex and capable with each contribution. The way a pinecone's scales spiral outward in a Fibonacci sequence represents the exponential growth and expanding capabilities of our AI as it learns from diverse, decentralized inputs.

This design reflects our approach to achieving true AGI — not through centralization, but through the strength and wisdom of a distributed network, learning and growing in harmony — much like the pinecone gradually matures, embodying the principles of unity, resilience, and shared progress.

## Logo Lockups

### Primary Lockup — Wordmark + Icon (Horizontal)

Used across the majority of Brand Collateral, and internal and external communications.

**This version MUST be used for the introduction of the Brand on all business collateral** — letterheads, email signatures, websites, business cards, billboards, etc.

#### Horizontal Format
- This format should be used in most horizontally framed content — Blog headers, Branded Campaigns, email signatures, etc.
- Used on initial page of all printed documents.
- Available in full color (brand maroon/pink pinecone + maroon wordmark), black & white (black pinecone + black wordmark on white), and reversed (white pinecone + white wordmark on dark backgrounds).

#### Approved Background Colors for Horizontal Lockup
- White / light gradient to pink
- Dark maroon/burgundy
- Medium pink
- Deep maroon/magenta
- Black (use white/reversed version)

### Vertical Format
- This format should be used in all areas where the content is taller than it is wide, and where a square format should be used.
- It should be the default logo used in most situations — Social Media profiles, app icons, apparel, etc.
- Available in full color, black & white, and reversed versions.

#### Approved Background Colors for Vertical Lockup
- White (full color pinecone + maroon wordmark)
- Light pink gradient (tonal/subtle treatment)
- Medium pink (lighter tonal treatment)
- Medium-dark pink (white wordmark)
- Deep maroon/magenta (white wordmark)

---

## Clear Space

**Clear space**, or negative space, is the area that surrounds the logo that is completely clear of any other graphical element.

Clear space helps the logo stand out from the rest of the elements on the page, and **ensures legibility**, even at smaller scales.

As a general rule, the more clear, or negative, space around the logo, the better.

**At a minimum**, there should be clear space equal to **twice the size of the "N"** on all sides for the vertical and horizontal lockups.

---

## Minimum Sizing

While we generally prefer the full vertical logo, ultimately it is up to the designer's discretion as to which format is best suited for the content being created.

**The minimum height is .75" for printed material.**

### Minimum Sizing for Digital Applications

#### Vertical Lockup
- Minimum: 60px wide × 76px tall

#### Horizontal Lockup
- Minimum: 120px wide × 38px tall

---

## Alternate Lockups

### Wordmark Solo

When space is at a premium, the Sentience Wordmark can be used in place of a full Brand Logo lockup.

At small sizes, ensure the line weight is legible.

The minimum height is .25" for printed material, and 113×12px for all digital applications.

#### Minimum Sizing for Digital: 96px wide × 12px tall

### Icon Solo

When subtlety is desired, the solo Sentience Icon can be used in place of a full Brand Logo lockup.

When this mark is used, ensure that our Brand name is visible near, or in relationship with the Icon to reinforce Brand Recognition, **and has been previously used in the full format at least once in the content being generated.**

Used on every page after the initial page in printed documents.

At small sizes, ensure the line weight is legible.

The minimum height is .75" for printed material, and 50px for all digital applications.

#### Minimum Sizing for Digital: 33px wide × 50px tall
